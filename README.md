# POP_Projekt_24Z

This repository contains a solution to a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths) that we've created as a project for a university course about optimization problems in machine learning. The achieved result was comparable to some of the best submissions for this competition.
